# Siege
Siege will be ACP's second gamemode, featuring a central, defending team called the Citadel, and a number of small attacking Raider teams around it.
The Citadel has a Keep, a zone of safety, as long as more than one Raider teams remain. Once only one is left, the Keep is destroyed.
Raiders can always build both turrets and units, whereas the Citadel may only build turrets so long as they possess a Keep.
Teams cannot venture too far from a core, however, as the Dead Zone will quickly kill anyone brave enough to try.

Currently in Alpha.
